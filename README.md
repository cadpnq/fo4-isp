# Intelligent Snap Points

Intelligent Snap Points (ISP) is a pure Papyrus library which adds two new events to settlement items: OnSnapped and OnUnsnapped.

Some implementation details are subject to change; therefore, it is not quite mature enough for general use. That said, I'm about to finalize what will be the 1.0 API. When that is done I will publish some documentation and you can use ISP without being afraid of me breaking compatibility between updates. If I end up needing to change things radically for some reason I will keep the older versions of the API around for backwards compatibility.
